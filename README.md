# Summary
This code attemps to find a clustering algorithm that best represent the housing data in Melbourne, Australia. This algorithm, from a group project at Northwestern University, uses k-means clusteringa nd hierarchical clustering using both RobustScaler and StandardScaler. The results of the models found that StandardScaler using k-means performed better than the other combinations. We further compared the clusterings to the proprety counts and housing types to look for any correlation between clustering groups and property types.
